### Hi there 👋
I'm Argel, a 2nd year Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson) 📚
- 🔭 I’m currently working on making native Android apps with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose!
- 🌐 Web Development is also one of my interests!
- 🌱 I finished the data structures course, woo!
